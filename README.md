## Overview
This project integrates OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API into any Unity project, allowing users to convert and synthesize text to spoken audio via any AudioSource component within seconds.

It *does not use third-party libraries*, making it super lightweight and easy to use cross-platform.

### What's new in v.1.1.
- Added a new custom editor script for easily setting up TTS within your Unity project (see demo videos below)

## Demos

Once you've installed this project, setting up OpenAI's TTS within Unity takes seconds. 

Integrate this project (either in your existing project, or in a fresh one), then open up the `TTS Setup` Prefab and click through the steps, as shown in this demo:

I've also added a quick UI example scene, so you can tinker around with some TTS settings easily:

### Setup
0. Download the latest release `.unitypackage`.
1. Import it into your own project, e.g. via `Assets > Import Package`.
2. Either open the `OpenAI-TTS-Example` scene, or open up the `TTS Setup` Prefab and click through the installation steps.
- Optional: Change the `TTSManager` Prefab settings to your liking (useful if you want to have different entities with predefined voices, speeds, etc.)
3. Reference the `TTSManager` and call `TTSManager.SynthesizeAndPlay` via script.

### Using OpenAI TTS in your own scene
0. Open up the `TTS Setup` Prefab.
1. Add your OpenAI API key first, then click through the installation steps.
- Optional: Change the `TTSManager` Prefab settings to your liking (useful if you want to have different entities with predefined voices, speeds, etc.)
2. Reference a `TTSManager` and call `TTSManager.SynthesizeAndPlay` via script.

### Disclaimer
This project is a prototype and serves as a basic example of integrating OpenAI's TTS API with Unity. Feel free to create a PR ðŸ˜Š
